## running the parallelized demo

this directory contains the necessary components to run 
a parallelized workflow by calling swift via R.

you must have swift installed on the machine on which you
are running. it can be downloaded here:

http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/downloads/index.php

then simply add the swift/bin directory to your PATH.

the tc.data file should be edited such that it contains
the absolute path to the RInvoke.sh script which is also
contained in this directory. 

you may then execute the demo SimpleParallel.R as you would
any other R script. note that the optimized model objects
will be written to the subdirectory results/models contained
in this demo direcotry.
