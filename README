This is the primary development trunk of the OpenMx project.  
The various parts of the project will go in here in different directories, as things progress.

Files:
'DESCRIPTION'	-	basic information about the package in a specific format (see 'Writing R Extensions')
'LICENSE'	-	a copy of the license to the package, e.g. a copy of the GNU public license.

Subdirectories:
'R'	-	R code files.
'man'	-	Documentation in .Rd format.
'src'	-	The sources and headers for compiled code, plus optionally a Makefile.
'tests'	-	package-specifc test code.
'demo'	-	R scripts (for running via demo()) that demonstrate some of the functionality of the package.
'models/passing' - OpenMx models that are currently executing sucessfully
'models/failing' - OpenMx models that are currently not executing succesfully
'data'	-	data files the package makes available for loading using data().

To install:

1. make build - builds the OpenMx library and placing it in ~/OpenMx/trunk/build/
2. make install - this creates the OpenMx library and tries to install it as an R library. You may need to be root to run this command.
3. make check - this creates the OpenMx library and runs the R library checker.
4. make clean - this cleans out the /build subdirectory. Sometimes you may need to run "make clean" if you get error messages with the other make build.
5. make veryclean - runs "make clean" and then deletes any files ending with a '~' character.
6. make test - runs all the models in the 'demo' and 'models/passing' directory to see if any errors are reported.
7. make doc - generate documentation in PDF format in the build directory.
