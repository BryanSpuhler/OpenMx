TRUNK
=============
* added checking and type coercion to arguments of mxPath() function (a beta tester alerted us to this)
* moved matrices into submodels in UnivariateTwinAnalysis_MatrixRaw demo
* added Beginners Guide to online documentation
* mxRun() issues an error when the back-end reports a negative status code
* named entities and free or fixed parameter names cannot be numeric values
* constant literals are allowed inside mxAlgebra() statements, e.g. mxAlgebra(1 + 2 + 3)
* constant literals can be of the form 1.234E+56 or 1.234e+56.
* type checking added to mxMatrix arguments (prompted by a forum post)
* mxPath() issues an error if any of the arguments are longer than the number of paths to be generated
* data frames are now accepted at the back-end
* FIML ordinal objective function is now working. Still a bit slow and inelegant, but working
* FIML ordinal now accepts algebras and matrices. dimnames of columns must match data elements
* implemented free parameter and fixed parameter substitution in mxAlgebra statements
* implemented global variable substitution in mxAlgebra statements
* turned off matrix and algebra substitution until a new proposal is decided
* snow and snowfall are no longer required packages
* added cycle detection to algebra expressions
* mxEval() with compute = TRUE will assign dimnames to algebras
* added dimnames checking of algebras in the front-end before optimization is called
* added 'make rproftest' target to makefile

Release 0.1.3-776
=============
* mxEvaluate() was renamed to mxEval() after input from beta testers on the forums.
* new function mxVersion that prints out the current version number (beta tester request).
* When printing OpenMx objects, the @ sign is used where it is needed if you would want to print part of the object (beta tester request).
* now supports PPC macs.
* implemented AIC, BIC and RMSEA calculations.
* mxMatrix documentation now talks about lower triangular matrices (beta tester request).
* fixed bugs in a number of demo scripts.
* added chi-square and p-value patch from beta tester Michael Scharkow.
* added comments to demo scripts.
* fixed a bug in the quadratic operator  (a beta tester alerted us to this).
* means vectors are now always 1xn matrices (beta tester request).
* added an option "compute" to mxEval() to precompute matrix expressions without going to the optimizer.
* Matrix algebra conformability is now tested in R at the beginning of each mxRun().
* named entities (i.e. mxMatrices, mxAlgebras, etc.) can no longer have the same name as the label of a free parameter.  (This seems obscure, but you will like what we do with it in the next version!)
* can use options(mxByrow=TRUE) in the R global options if you always read your matrices in with the byrow=TRUE argument.  Saves some typing.  (beta tester request)
* fixed the standard error estimates summary.
* added mxVersion() function to return the version number (as a string).

Release 0.1.2-708
=============
* Added R help documentation for omxCheckCloseEnough(), omxCheckWithinPercentError(), 
	omxCheckTrue(), omxCheckEquals(), and omxCheckSetEquals()

* (mxMatrix) Fixed a bug in construction of symmetric matrixes.
    - now supports lower, standardized, and subdiagonal matrices.

Release 0.1 (August 3, 2009)
============================
* (mxEvaluate) mxEvaluate translates MxMatrix references, MxAlgebra references,  MxObjectiveFunction references, and label references.

* (mxOptions) added 'reset' argument to mxOptions()

* (mxPath) renamed 'start' argument of mxPath() to 'values'
    - renamed 'name' argument of mxPath() to 'labels'
    - renamed 'boundMin' argument of mxPath() to 'lbound'
    - renamed 'boundMax' argument of mxPath() to 'ubound'
    - eliminated 'ciLower' argument of mxPath()
    - eliminated 'ciUpper' argument of mxPath()
    - eliminated 'description' argument of mxPath()

* (dimnames) implemented dimnames(x) for MxMatrix objects
    - implemented dimnames(x) <- value for MxMatrix objects
    - implemented dimnames(x) for MxAlgebra objects
    - implemented dimnames(x) <- value for MxAlgebra objects

* (mxMatrix) added 'dimnames' argument to mxMatrix()

* (mxData) renamed 'vector' argument of mxData() to 'means'
